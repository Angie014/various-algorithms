Algorithms to compute various types of numbers implemented with python.

- Computer Divisors: those values that divide the number into exact parts.
- Friends Number:function that finds two in an invert it given positive integers a and b such that the sum of the proper divisors of one is equal to the other number and vice versa, that is, σ (a) = b and σ (b) = a, where σ (n) is equal to the sum of the divisors of n, not including n.
- Social numbers:
- Perfect numbers:
