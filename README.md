# various-algorithms
Algorithms to compute various types of numbers implemented with python.

- **Computer Divisors**: those values that divide the number into exact parts.
- **Factors numbers**: The factors of a number are the numbers that divide evenly into the number. 
- **Friends Number**: function that finds two in an invert it given positive integers a and b such that the sum of the proper divisors of one is equal to the other number and vice versa, that is, σ (a) = b and σ (b) = a, where σ (n) is equal to the sum of the divisors of n, not including n.
- **Social numbers**:finds a set of sociable numbers in a given invert, it is an aliquot sequence, or a sequence of numbers in which each term is equal to the sum of the factors proper to the previous term.
- **Perfect numbers**: find is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive proper divisors.
